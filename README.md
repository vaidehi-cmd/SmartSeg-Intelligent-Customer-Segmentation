SmartSeg: Intelligent Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

☀️ What is SmartSeg Intelligent Customer Segmentation?

SmartSeg is the process of categorising customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as behaviour, preferences, and purchasing habits. By leveraging these insights, companies can target their marketing efforts more effectively and create tailored strategies for each customer segment.

☀️ Introduction:

Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning task, is designed to identify natural groups within an unlabeled dataset. It is widely used in various fields, including:

Customer segmentation for targeted marketing

Image segmentation for computer vision tasks

Document clustering for better information retrieval

☀️ Objective:

This project demonstrates customer segmentation for a shopping mall using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to explore and compare five popular clustering methods: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Clustering, Mini-batch K-Means Clustering, and DBSCAN Clustering. This project will cover the basics of clustering and explore more advanced aspects of each technique.
